"name":"Paneer Paratha",


"description":'Take whole wheat flour or atta in a bowl. Pour a small quantity of water and knead. Keep adding water as desired and
knead smooth, soft dough. Let it rest for 20 minutes.
Prepare the stuffing by grating paneer into small particles. Add finely chopped green chillies, coriander, onion, and
spices. Mix everything well and keep aside.
Take a small portion of the dough and roll it out roughly. Place a spoonful of the paneer filling in the centre and
seal it from all sides. Flatten and roll out again. Use dry flour as required during the process. Make as many parathas
as you need with this process.
Once you get a half-inch thick paratha, heat the tawa. Transfer the paratha onto the tawa and let it cook on one side.
Meanwhile, apply ghee or oil on the other side.
Flip it and cook on the other side. Press gently with a spatula so that it roasts properly. Apply some more ghee on
the top side before flipping again.
Once the paratha is cooked properly on both sides and turns brown, take it off the flame. Serve with dahi, chutney or
pickle of choice!'

"description" : 'To make this kulfi, first we need to boil the milk till it reduces to half its original quantity. Now, add sugar and
pista and allow it to cool completely. (Boiling the milk may take around 30-40 minutes, so make sure to keep stirring it
occasionally.)
Meanwhile, remove the seed of the mango while keeping its shape intact. Remove the top part of the mango and keep it
aside for later use. Gently squeeze the mango and use a knife to loosen the pulp around the seed. Pull it out and keep
it upright in a cup or glass.
Fill these mango shells with the prepared kulfi mixture and put the top part of the mango on it. Freeze for 3 to 4
hours, remove the peel, cut it into slices, and serve chilled.',
